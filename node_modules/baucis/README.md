baucis v0.6.13
==============

Baucis is Express middleware that creates configurable REST APIs using Mongoose schemata.

Like Baucis and Philemon of old, this library provides REST to the weary traveler.  The goal is to create a JSON REST API for Mongoose & Express that matches as closely as possible the richness and versatility of the [HTTP 1.1 protocol](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html).

Baucis uses [semver](http://semver.org).

What's New
----------

A [change log](CHANGES.md) has been added with info about each new release.  Check there for the latest update notes.

[Swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/) support is being added.  Most basic functionality is tested and seems to be working well!  Want to check it out?  Create your API with the swagger option enabled:

    app.use('/api/v1', baucis({ swagger: true }));

Next, download the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) client.

    git clone git@github.com:wordnik/swagger-ui.git
    open swagger-ui/dist/index.html

Point it at your API.  Something like:

    http://localhost:8012/api/v1/api-docs

Now you have documentation and a test client for free!

Usage
-----

To install:

    npm install baucis

An example of creating a REST API from a couple Mongoose schemata:

    var Vegetable = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String });
    var Fruit = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String });

    // Note that Mongoose middleware will be executed as usual
    Vegetable.pre('save', function () { ... });

    // Register the schemata
    mongoose.model('vegetable', Vegetable);
    mongoose.model('fruit', Fruit);

    // Create the API routes
    baucis.rest('vegetable');
    baucis.rest('fruit');

    // Create the app and listen for API requests
    var app = express();
    app.use('/api/v1', baucis());
    app.listen(80);

Later, make requests:

| HTTP Verb     | /vegetables   | /vegetables/:id |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| GET           | Get all or a subset of documents | Get the addressed document |
| POST          | Creates new documents and sends them back.  You may post a single document or an array of documents.      | n/a |
| PUT           | n/a | Update the addressed document |
| DELETE        | Delete all or a subset of documents | Delete the addressed object |

HTTP Headers
------------

| Header Field | Notes |
| ------------ | ----- |
| ETag | Used for HTTP caching based on response body.  Supported out-of-the-box by Express. |
| Last-Modified | Used for HTTP caching.  Can be set automatically by Baucis.  Pass `lastModified: 'foo'` to `baucis.rest` in order to set the path to be used (currently it must be a `Date`). GET requests to the collection set this to the latest date out of all documents returned by the query.
| Accept | Set to `application/json`  for all responses. |
| Allow | Set automatically, correctly removing HTTP verbs when those verbs have been disabled by e.g. passing `put: false` to `baucis.rest`.  Example: `Allow: HEAD, GET, POST`. |
| Location | Set to the URL of the created/edited entity for PUT and POST responses. |
| Link | If `relations: true` is passed to `baucis.rest`, this header will be set with various related links for all responses.  As of v0.5.4, `first`, `last`, `next`, and `previous` links are added when paging through a collection with `limit`/`skip`. |

Query Options
-------------

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| conditions | Set the Mongoose query's `find` or `remove` arguments |
| skip | Don't send the first *n* matched documents in the response |
| limit | Limit the response document count to *n* |
| select | Set which fields should be selected for response documents |
| sort | Sort response documents by the given criteria.  `sort: 'foo -bar'`' sorts the collection by `foo` in ascending order, then by `bar` in descending order. |
| populate | Set which fields should be populated for response documents.  See the Mongoose [population documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) for more information. |
| count | May be set to true for GET requests to specify that a count should be return instead of documents |

It is not permitted to use the `select` query option to select deselected paths.  This is to allow a mechanism for hiding fields from client software.

The `select` option of `populate` is disallowed.  Only paths deselected at the model level will be deselected in populate queries.

You can deselect paths in the schema definition using `select: false` or in the controller options using `select: '-foo'` and your server middleware will be able to select these fields as usual using `query.select`, while preventing the client from selecting the field.

`baucis.rest`
-------------

`baucis.rest` returns an instance of the controller created to handle the schema's API routes.

    var controller = baucis.rest({ ... });

For simple controllers, only the schema name need be passed.

    var controller = baucis.rest('robot');

Controllers are Express apps; they may be used as such.

    var controller = baucis.rest('robot');

    // Add middleware before API routes
    controller.use('/qux', function (request, response, next) {
      // Do something coolâ€¦
      next();
    });

    controller.get('/readme', function (request, response, next) {
      // Send a readme document about the resource (for example)
      next();
    });

    // Do other stuff...
    controller.set('some option name', 'value');
    controller.listen(3000);

Customize them with plain old Express/Connect middleware, including pre-existing modules like `passport`.  Middleware can be registered like so:

    controller.request(function (request, response, next) {
      if (request.isAuthenticated()) return next();
      return response.send(401);
    });

Baucis adds middleware registration functions for three stages of the request cycle:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| request | This stage of middleware will be called after baucis applies defaults based on the request, but before the Mongoose query is generated |
| query | This stage of middleware will be called after baucis applies defaults to the Mongoose query object, but before the documents or count are retrieved from the database.  The query can be accessed in your custom middleware via `request.baucis.query`.  Query middleware cannot be added explicitly for POST and will be ignored when added for POST implicitly.  |
| documents | This stage of middleware will be called after baucis executes the query, but before the documents or count are sent in the response.  The documents/count can be accessed in your custom middleware via `request.baucis.documents`.  |

Each of these functions has three forms:

To apply middleware to all API routes, just pass the function or array to the method for the appropriate stage:

    controller.request(function (request, response, next) {
      if (request.isAuthenticated()) return next();
      return response.send(401);
    });

    controller.documents(function (request, response, next) {
      if (typeof request.baucis.documents === 'number') return next();
      if (!Array.isArray(request.baucis.documents)) return next();

      request.baucis.documents.pop();
      next();
    });

To add middleware that applies only to specific HTTP verbs, use the second form.  It adds a paramater that must contain a space-delimted list of HTTP verbs that the middleware should be applied to.

    controller.query('head get put', function (request, response, next) {
      request.baucis.query.sort('-created');
      next();
    });

The final form is the most specific.  The first argument lets you specify whether the middleware applies to document instances (paths like `/foos/:id`) or to collection requests (paths like `/foos`).

    controller.request('instance', 'head get del', middleware);
    controller.request('collection', 'post', middleware);

Controller Options
------------------

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| singular | The name of the schema, as registered with `mongoose.model`. |
| plural | This will be set automatically using the `lingo` module, but may be overridden by passing it into `baucis.rest`.
| basePath | Defaults to `/`.  Used for embedding a controller in another controller. |
| publish | Set to `false` to not publish the controller's endpoints when `baucis()` is called. |
| select | Select or deselect fields for all queries e.g. `'foo +bar -password'` |
| findBy | Use another field besides `_id` for entity queries. |
| lastModified | Set the `Last-Modified` HTTP header using the given field.  Currently this field must be a `Date`. |
| head, get, post, put, del | May be set to false to disable those HTTP verbs completely for the controller |

An example of embedding a controller within another controller

    var subcontroller = baucis.rest({
      singular: 'bar',
      basePath: '/:fooId/bars',
      publish: false
    });

    subcontroller.query(function (request, response, next) {
      // Only retrieve bars that are children of the given foo
      request.baucis.query.where('parent', request.params.fooId);
      next();
    });

    // Didn't publish, so have to manually initialize
    subcontroller.initialize();

    var controller = baucis.rest('foo');

    // Embed the subcontroller at /foos/:fooId/bars
    controller.use(subcontroller);
